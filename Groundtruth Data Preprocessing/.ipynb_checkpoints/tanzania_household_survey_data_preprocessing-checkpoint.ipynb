    "# Preprocessing & Calculate FCS and HDDS From Household Survey Data Of Tanzania\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Python notebook, we will explore the process of preprocessing household survey data from Tanzania to compute two food security indicators: **Food Consumption Score (FCS)** and **Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS)**. These indicators play a crucial role in assessing food security and nutritional status at the household level. The aim of calculating these indicators is to use them as ground truth data in the research project of using machine learning and deep learning for prediction for security indicators(FCS and HDDS) from heterogenous data.\n",

    "### Food Security Indicators\n",
    "    \n",
    "These are quantitative measures used to evaluate the accessibility, availability, and utilization of food at various levels starting from households,community to the national level. These indicators provide insights into the extent and severity of food insecurity, helping policymakers, researchers, and practitioners to identify vulnerable populations and design targeted interventions. There are numbers of food security indicators however as we mentioned early we will only focus on two indicators which are **Food Consumption Score(FCS)** and **Household Dietary Diversity Score(HDDS)**. The details description of these indicators will be given to the [Computation of FCS and HDDS](#compute_fcs_hdds) section.\n",

    "### About Tanzania\n",
    "    \n",
    "Tanzania is a country located in East Africa,it's economy is primarily driven by agriculture,despite being an agricultural country, Tanzania faces challenges with malnutrition and lack of dietary diversity, particularly in rural areas.Many households rely heavily on staple crops such as maize, rice, and cassava, leading to a limited variety in diets and micronutrient deficiencies. Also poverty remains a significant barrier that makes many households struggle to afford an adequate and nutritious diet. Apart from that limited access to markets, infrastructure, and transportation exacerbates food insecurity, particularly in remote and rural areas.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working with National Panel Survey (NPS) data from Tanzania which are public available on [National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)](https://www.nbs.go.tz/index.php/en/)\n",
    ". The NPS is a household survey conducted at a national level, offering insights into poverty levels, agricultural productivity, and various crucial development metrics. It's characterized as an \"integrated\" survey because it encompasses diverse subjects within a single questionnaire, spanning from education and healthcare to issues like crime, gender-based violence and food security. Since our topic is concering about food security we will only focus on the data which are relevant to our topic.\n",

It serves as an essential index for assessing household food consumption patterns and nutritional adequacy. The data to compute the FCS are collected by household survey questionnaire by asking a respondent the list of food groups they have consumed for the past seven days. The FCS aggregates these data on the diversity and frequency of food groups consumed over the previous seven days **(7)** which is then weighted according to the relative nutritional value of the consumed food groups as specified in the table below.\n",

The upper limit of the food frequency of each food groups is set to a maximum of 7 to prevent biasing the score upwards. This approach is used to prevent the bias of the score when there is an increasing of the number of food items/groups used in questionnaire(and later collapsed into the food groups for the FCS calculation). Assuming the questionnaire gathers the consumption of maize, rice,wheat and these foods are all consumed in combinatination, let say the frequency of maize=3, rice=3, wheat=3, all of these fall into the food group of cereals then the frequency of the cereals will be 9, thus biasing the score.

    "\n",
    "Household dietary diversity Score (HDDS) is a qualitative measure of food consumption that reflects household access to a variety of foods that indicate dietary diversity and nutritional quality.The HDDS consists of a simple count of food groups that a household has consumed over the preceding 24 hours. Each food group is assigned a score of **1 (if consumed over the previous 24 hours)** or **0 (if not consumed in the last 24 hours)**. The household score will range between 0 to 12 and is equal to the total number of food groups consumed by the household.\n",

The Feed the Future Interim Supplemental Survey (FTFISS) include Household questionnaire to measure and elaborate on consumption habits in Tanzania, and to provide a more comprehensive view of the food security situation in the country. Additionally, this project provides a valuable opportunity to expand upon food security information gathered in the Tanzania National Panel Survey (NPS), as questionnaire themes in the FTFISS were modeled to reflect those topics considered central to the comprehension of food security.The NPS interviewed 727 households in the regions of Dodoma, Manyara, Morogoro, Mbeya, Iringa, and all three areas of Unguja in Zanzibar.For more description [Click Here](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/2863/study-description).
