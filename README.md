It consist of Five Directories each containing notebook for processing individual data falling in that category!

Each notebook provide a description of the data collected with their respective source and API used for data retrieava.

To create the environment that contains all the packages and libraries used for this task follow the following process:
1. Download the env.yml file
2. Open a terminal (Anaconda Prompt or any other terminal).
3. Create the environment using the downloaded YAML file by running this command:
        conda env create --file env.yml
4. Activate the new environment:
        conda activate env
5. Verify the environment:
       conda list

After this step you can be able to use the notebook without any problem, but you should make sure to download the data and some of them need authentication that you need to ask from the data sources! Good Luck
